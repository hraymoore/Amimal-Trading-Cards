          Bighorn sheep groups protect themselves from predators by facing
          different directions, allowing them to keep watch on their
          surroundings.

        <p>
          Bighorn Sheep are large mammals that are relatives of goats. They have
          short brown fur, a white muzzle and rump patch. They have split hooves
          which aid in balance and rough hoof bottoms for natural grip. Their
          sure footing help them move easily around rugged mountain terrain.
