			<p> Bighorn Sheep are large mammals that are relatives of goats. They have short brown fur, a white muzzle and rump patch. They have split hooves which aid in balance and rough hoof bottoms for natural grip. Their sure footing help them move easily around rugged mountain terrain. The male Bighorn sheep is called a ram and can be recognized by his massive brown horns. The horns curl back over the ears, down, and up past the cheeks. By the time a ram reaches 7 or 8 years of age, he can have a set of horns with a full curl. </p>
